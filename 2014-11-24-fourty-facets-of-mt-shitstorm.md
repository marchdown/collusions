## I am a shim. Shim me. Shim on!

**âˆž**

I am the body of a shim. Shim me, mold me, spin me out, commiserate with my unenviable fate. I am but a placeholder for things to come, things which no one in their right conscience does not expect to come. Still, waiting, as for [Godot](https://ddg.gg/!+En+Attendant+Godot). Once the wake is broken, no trace of me remains. Everything's in motion, has always been in motion, as if I was never there. So it goes.
